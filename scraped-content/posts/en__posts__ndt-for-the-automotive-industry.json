  "markdown": "## Experts in the testing of automotive parts\n\nNon-destructive testing of components using industrial CT has been an integral part of quality assurance in the automotive industry for many years. Manufacturers know that quick feedback in the event of deviations in product quality saves costs. In times of lightweight construction, the transition to electromobility and increased efforts to reduce CO2, this is all the more true.\n\nMicrovista’s service helps with a wide range of challenges, e.g. when it comes to systematically uncovering and eliminating the causes of errors or when batches cannot be released due to potential defects.\n\nPrevention is often better than cure. With our fast and reliable CT service, you can keep an eye on everything. This far-sightedness saves you time and money across the entire production process.\n\n## Practical example: E-mobility drivetrain\n\n![Industrielle CT in der Automobilindustrie für Gehäuse von Statoren](https://www.microvista.de/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/stators.jpg)\n\n### Challenge:\n\nPrevent impermissibly thin walls in the cooling jacket \n\n### Possible consequences:\n\nBreakdown at full load and risk of field failures occurring \n\n### Advantages of the CT test:\n\nRapid detection of fault hotspots to stabilize production processes through fully automated and cost-effective CT evaluation  \n\n![Schweißung von Hairpin und Kontaktiersystem](https://www.microvista.de/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/hairpin-and-laser-welding.jpg)\n\n### Challenge:\n\nHigh mechanical load of laser joints (e.g. welding of hairpins or contacting systems) \n\n### Possible consequences:\n\nField failures with possible recalls due to systematic deviations\n\n### Advantages of the CT test:\n\nProcess reliability and stability thanks to regular spot checks including rapid automatic determination of the most important quality parameters\n\n![CT-Bild löchrige Kurzschlussringe](https://www.microvista.de/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/computed-tomography-scanning-automotive-industry.jpg)\n\n### Challenge:\n\nHoley short-circuit rings and shrink plugs on their connecting rods in asynchronous motors\n\n### Possible consequences:\n\nMalfunction in use \n\n### Advantages of the CT test:\n\nChecking the mechanical stability of the laminated core\n\n[Schedule a free consultation here!](https://www.microvista.de/en/contact/)\n\n## Practical example: combustion engine drivetrain\n\n![CT-Bild eines Verbrennungsmotors in 2D](https://www.microvista.de/wp-content/uploads/elementor/thumbs/combustion-engine-powertrain-CT-scan-qaw96he1vdur3nyxbjkimikt3geqzerdqz2y1f81gi.png)\n\n### Challenge:\n\nFate of inorganic binders in cavities \n\n### Possible consequences:\n\nFunctional impairment due to adhering core residues in cooling ducts (failure of pumps and auxiliary units possible due to detachment of these) \n\n### Advantages of the CT test:\n\nNon-destructive testing can even be carried out on a fully assembled motor for acute damage limitation or as a preventive measure in the event of suspicion (FMEA) \n\n![CT-Bild eines Verbrennungsmotors in 3D](https://www.microvista.de/wp-content/uploads/elementor/thumbs/combustion-engine-powertrain-3D-qaw96gg7ojtgs20ah15w20tci2jdrpnneufgk59fmq.png)\n\n### Challenge:\n\nHigh technological requirements for wall thicknesses and mechanical load capacity due to increased motor power and simultaneous mass reduction\n\n### Possible consequences:\n\nFailure to achieve machine capability (risk of overheating and wall breakthroughs under load) \n\n### Advantages of the CT test:\n\nDimensional inspection of individual and critical  features with rapid OK/NOK assessment \n\n![Industrielle CT in der Automobilindustrie für einen CAD Soll-Ist-Vergleich eines Motorblocks](https://www.microvista.de/wp-content/uploads/elementor/thumbs/combustion-engine-powertrain-CAD-target-actual-comparison-qaw96he1vdur3nyxbjkimikt3geqzerdqz2y1f81gi.jpg)\n\n### Challenge:\n\nCommissioning a new production batch after a long time – does the mold really match the current CAD?\n\n### Possible consequences:\n\nLost production (detection of missing contour only in final assembly) \n\n### Advantages of the CT test:\n\nQuick detection of unwanted deviations and other shortcomings  through CAD target/actual comparison (needs-based maintenance of core boxes and molds possible)\n\n## Testing of structural components\n\nThe production of structural components is technologically challenging, as hybrid structures, e.g. made of different metals and fiber composites, are created using sophisticated joints, and mechanical parameters may not be achieved, resulting in malfunctions in critical components. Non-destructive testing with CT can be used in the automotive industry to gain feedback for process improvement and to sort out faulty parts. \n\n## Assembly and joint inspection with industrial CT\n\nYour product is not working and you can’t find the reason? Are you unsure whether the assembly was carried out correctly? Disassembly is not permitted, unsuitable for analysis or too time-consuming?\n\nWithout disassembly, completeness, correct fit and sufficiently good joint can be checked. \n\n[Schedule a free consultation here!](https://www.microvista.de/en/contact/)",
