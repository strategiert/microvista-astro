  "markdown": "After the ScanExpress arrived at Microvista at the end of March this year and the last remaining work was carried out, it has now set off on its first journey. **A global casting technology company** that focuses on providing systems for the **mobility industry** will be using the mobile CT at its German site for **several months**. The ScanExpress was accompanied on its first trip by a number of Microvista experts, who gave the customer’s team professional on-site instruction.\n\n## How the first customer uses the ScanExpress\n\nOur first ScanExpress customer is working for an end customer who has asked to **solve problems with capacity blockages during machining**.\n\nGearbox housings need to be inspected for pores and other **defects in the machined surfaces** of the raw parts immediately after casting. The ScanExpress is used to prevent rejects from being processed further. It is in operation 24 hours a day, for which it inspects in a **three-shift system**.\n\nThe intensive and fast component inspection prevents the tying up of value-added resources and **does not block capacities at processing machines**.\n\n[More information about  \nthe mobile CT](https://www.mobile-ct.eu/en/)\n\n![ScanExpress abgeladen beim ersten Kunden](https://www.microvista.de/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/ScanExpress-abgeladen-beim-ersten-Kunden.webp)\n\n## Quality assurance directly on the spot\n\nBeing able to inspect components **directly at the production site without logistical effort** is one of the advantages of the mobile CT, which is why our customer decided to use it. Value-added losses and capacity blockages that could not be solved before by means of pure X-ray inspection are now a thing of the past.\n\nThe casting technology company also wants to establish non-destructive component testing by means of industrial CT as an inspection method in the future. Consequently, the ScanExpress is used **cost- and time-efficiently** to achieve the end customer’s order and achieves great **added value for both parties**.\n\n[Secure free  \nconsultation](https://www.microvista.de/en/contact/)",
