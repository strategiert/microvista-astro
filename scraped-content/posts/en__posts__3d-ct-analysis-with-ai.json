  "markdown": "Today, high-performance motors have to deliver **more power in a smaller space** – and work more efficiently at the same time. This development poses new and demanding challenges for quality control in production. Conventional inspection methods are reaching their limits. A pioneering solution: **3D computed tomography (CT) combined with artificial intelligence (AI)**.\n\nAt **Microvista**, we offer customised solutions for **3D CT analysis in industrial quality assurance** – especially for the requirements of the engine industry. \n\n## Compact design and thermal management: a balancing act for motor technology\n\nIn order to increase efficiency and performance, manufacturers are increasingly focussing on **compact design and lightweight construction**. This often leads to a reduction in cubic capacity while maintaining or even increasing performance. However, **thermal management** plays a decisive role in these smaller, powerful engines in particular.\n\nThe challenge: **cooling ducts with very small cross-sections** must be manufactured flawlessly in order to avoid heat build-up. Even the smallest burrs or residues impair the coolant flow and therefore the performance and service life of the engine. \n\n## 3D CT and AI: high-precision inspection for maximum quality\n\nIndustrial **3D computed tomography** makes it possible to fully X-ray components and generate precise 3D models. In combination with **AI-supported analysis**, this opens up completely new dimensions in defect detection:\n\n### Automated detection\n\nIdentification of burrs, blowholes or core residues using state-of-the-art technology and reduction of the error rate.\n\n### Volume-based analysis\n\n3D result data (e.g. pore volume) go far beyond what visual or X-ray inspections can  \nachieve.\n\n### Fast test cycles\n\nThe evaluation time no longer restricts throughput and thus enables more efficient testing.\n\n![CT Software - Grafik zeigt schnell, präzise und einfache Auswertung](https://www.microvista.de/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/CT-Software-Grafik-zeigt-schnell-praezise-und-einfache-Auswertung-300x251.webp)\n\n**Microvista GmbH** offers specially developed [**CT inspection solutions with AI support**](https://www.industrial-ct-software.com/de/ct-software/) that can be customised precisely to the requirements of engine production. \n\n[More information about our CT software](https://www.industrial-ct-software.com/)\n\n## Flexible solutions: Mobile CT inspection systems such as the ScanExpress\n\nAnother highlight is the **ScanExpress** from Microvista – a **mobile CT solution** that can be quickly and easily integrated into existing production environments. Ideal for production start-ups, pilot series or blocked batches, our customers benefit from: \n\n### Flexibility\n\n... through mobile usability\n\n### Fast availability\n\n... without large investments\n\n### Customisation\n\n... of the CT software on the component pattern\n\nThe ScanExpress is available in two sizes: the classic Long version and, since last year, the Compact version. \n\n[More information on the mobile CT solution](https://www.mobile-ct.eu/)\n\n## The future of engine production starts today - with Microvista\n\nThe combination of 3D CT and AI sets new standards in industrial quality control. Especially in the development and production of high-performance engines, this use of technology offers a decisive competitive advantage.\n\nThose who rely on state-of-the-art testing technologies such as those from **Microvista** ensure that engines fulfil the highest demands in terms of **performance, reliability and durability**.\n\nWould you like to find out more about how 3D CT and AI can improve your quality assurance? Our experts at **Microvista** will advise you individually and without obligation. \n\n[Contact our industrial CT service team](https://www.microvista.de/en/contact/)",
