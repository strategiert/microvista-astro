  "markdown": "## Day of arrival\n\nHow did the arrival of the mobile CT proceed?\n\nAfter completion and transport to the site, a mobile crane was used to unload the container of the SCANEXPRESS from the trailer. Due to the professional use of the crane, it was unloaded quickly and safely. In the future, the mobile CT will again be on a trailer, and will be driven to its test sites in this configuration. Depending on the circumstances, a decision is then made whether the container should remain on the trailer or be unloaded. The SCANEXPRESS can be operated in an outdoor environment as well as inside a factory building.\n\n## Tour of the mobile CT\n\nFor many employees of Microvista and its sister company NetCo, the arrival of the SCANEXPRESS was a big event. For the first time they could directly see the implementation of the idea they had seen a few years ago.\n\nAfter arrival they were guided by the CEO Prof. Dr. Lutz Hagner and the Product Owner of CT, Sebastian Blasek. It was an emotional moment for everyone involved to see the finished mobile CT after many years of development, planning and the final construction phase.\n\n## What happens next?\n\nThe mobile CT is being continuously developed and adapted to ensure that it delivers the best results for future use. In the coming weeks, it will approved by a radiation protection expert. In addition, it will be wrapped on the outside. \n\nMore information about the mobile CT can be found here: [SCANEXPRESS](https://www.mobile-ct.eu/)\n\nHow does it work?: [operating the mobile CT](https://www.microvista.de/en/scanexpress-how-does-the-mobile-ct-work/)\n\nFirst scans: [test scan of a gaming controller](https://www.microvista.de/en/first-test-scans-with-the-mobile-ct/)",
