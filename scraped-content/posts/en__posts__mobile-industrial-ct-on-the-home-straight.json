Before each delivery to the customer, the mobile CT is put through its paces to ensure that everything runs smoothly in operation. In addition, it is adapted to the individual examination task. This means that a quick system calibration can be carried out after shipment. The result is a real-time evaluation with AI and an automatic report after each inspection.",
