  "markdown": "## Non-destructive testing methods in comparison:\n\nWhen inspecting casting parts, such as those made of iron or aluminum casting, various non-destructive testing methods are available, each with their own advantages and disadvantages.\n\n**X-ray diffraction (RT)**, for example, is an accurate method, but it requires expensive equipment and long examination times. It also produces only 2D images, which have superpositions for complex structures.\n\n**Ultrasonic testing (UT)** is very easy to perform and equipment is comparatively inexpensive. However, this method can be unreliable for thin or hollow objects and does not allow three-dimensional images. Usually, coupling agents are required for an ultrasonic inspection. An exception to this is an inspection using [air-coupled ultrasonic](https://www.youscan.eu/en/).\n\n**Magnetic particle testing (MT)** inspection is also easy to perform and suitable for metallic materials, but its accuracy is low.\n\n**Penetrant testing (PT)** is a fast and inexpensive inspection technique, but it is only suitable for certain materials and defect types and cannot produce three-dimensional images of objects. The material must be porous enough to accept the carrier medium, but also strong enough to impede the propagation of the carrier medium when it encounters defects. This is where eddy current testing can be used as a supplement to allow depth determination of any defects found.\n\n**Visual inspections (VT)** are a quick and inexpensive way to detect superficial defects in materials. However, they are not suitable for deeper defects and their accuracy depends on the experience and competence of the inspector.\n\nComputed tomography (CT), on the other hand, provides accurate results & three-dimensional images. It can be used to detect and repair cracks, porosity or air pockets at an early stage, which increases the quality and service life of casting parts. Normally, equipment is expensive and examination times are long. However, something can be done about this.\n\n## In this way, the disadvantages of industrial CT are eliminated:\n\n### No high investment costs:\n\nIndustrial computed tomography (CT) can be expensive compared to other testing methods, as CT equipment requires specialized technology and sophisticated software. To avoid high costs, you can use the services of an industrial CT service provider like Microvista. With Microvista, it is possible to send in your components for inspection, rent a mobile CT or outsource the evaluation to a cloud solution. This eliminates high investment costs.\n\n### Difficult to radiate materials possible\n\nOne disadvantage of CT is that it can only be used to radiate through limited wall thicknesses. Since heavy metals such as iron are dense materials, CT can reach its limits with large wall thicknesses. To counteract this, Microvista relies on a 450kV tube, which can achieve a particularly high photon velocity, making non-destructive testing of thicker-walled iron components up to approx. 70 mm possible.\n\n### High testing speed\n\nCT examinations usually require more time than other inspection methods. Since this can be a disadvantage in some situations, especially when results need to be available quickly, Microvista uses customized evaluation solutions that shorten the inspection process to a minimum through automation.\n\nDue to Microvista’s expertise in terms of service portfolio, X-ray technology as well as evaluation, the known disadvantages of CT can be leveraged. This leaves the advantages, such as high accuracy and the ability to create three-dimensional images of objects, that other inspection methods do not offer. Therefore, it is the best choice for quality control of casting parts.\n\n## Identify typical defects in iron casting with CT\n\n### Crack testing\n\nCrack in the part in a 3D view:\n\n![Zerstörungsfreie Prüfung von Eisenguss zeigt einen Riss im 3D-CT-Bild](https://www.microvista.de/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/3D-Bild-Rissprufung-Eisenguss-mit-CT-1.webp)\n\nCrack in the part in a 2D view:\n\n![Riss im Krümmer wird mit dem zerstörungsfreien Prüfverfahren industrielle CT sichtbar](https://www.microvista.de/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Riss-im-Kruemmer-durch-CT-sichtbar.jpg)\n\n### Porosity analysis\n\nPores in the part in a 3D view:\n\n![3D-Bild Porositätsanalyse von Eisenguss mit CT](https://www.microvista.de/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/3D-Bild-Porositatsanalyse-von-Eisenguss-mit-CT.webp)\n\nPores in the part in a 2D view:\n\n![Zerstörungsfreie Prüfung von Eisenguss mittels CT macht Pore sichtbar](https://www.microvista.de/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/CT-Bild-Pore-im-Eisenguss.webp)\n\n## Options for non-destructive testing of casting parts\n\n### Serial testing\n\nComplicated components in high-quality end products? Major damage with quality defects that far exceed manufacturing costs? Safety-relevant components that require 100% inspection?\n\nIn these cases, fast, low-effort & non-destructive testing with industrial CT is needed. Due to ready-made process & automation modules, high levels of maturity are realized quickly & at low cost.\n\n#### Inspection in the Microvista test lab\n\n![Series testing procedure at Microvista](https://www.microvista.de/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Series-testing-procedure-at-Microvista..png)\n\n\\*Note: Scan within 24h only with consultation & depending on the number of parts.\n\n#### Automated evaluation of your CT scan via Microvista Cloud\n\nUpload CT scans to the Microvista Cloud & have them evaluated automatically. Save time as time-consuming manual evaluation is not required.\n\n[Learn more](https://www.microvista.de/en/industrial-computed-tomography/services/ct-data-analysis/)\n\n#### Mobile CT solution\n\nYou need a CT inspection only temporarily & do not want to ship your components for an inspection?  Then rent a CT system only as long as you need it! With Microvista’s unique mobile CT solution you save high investment costs & long waiting times. \n\n![Mobiles CT - Microvista ScanExpress](https://www.microvista.de/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Mobiles-CT-Microvista-ScanExpress.webp)\n\n[Learn more](https://www.mobile-ct.eu)\n\n### Sampling\n\nNeed for inspection in case of acute problems in production? Customer returns? Qualification of product changes?\n\nReliable statements on product condition, inclusions, blowholes or other properties must be available quickly in order to react in time and draw the right conclusions. Expertise in the planning and execution of the CT scan as well as in the subsequent analysis are crucial for this.\n\n#### Inspection in the Microvista test lab\n\n![Sampling procedure with CT](https://www.microvista.de/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Sampling-procedure-with-CT.png)\n\n\\*\\*Note: Turnaround time by arrangement, usually < 3 days for standard tasks. \n\n#### Expert evaluation of your CT Scan via the Microvista Cloud\n\nYou have your own CT, but lack the resources to evaluate your single part scans?! The CT experts at Microvista will take over your evaluations. Whether initial sampling or requalification of components based on relevant standards or detailed analysis of defect focal points.
