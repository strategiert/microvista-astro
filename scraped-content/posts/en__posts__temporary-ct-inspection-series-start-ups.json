  "markdown": "**Production start, high cycle rate – and suddenly quality problems?** Whether a new component can be manufactured economically is particularly crucial in the early series phase. Industrial **computed tomography (CT)** offers fast, non-destructive insights into the interior of the component – especially when it comes to **invisible defects such as burrs, blowholes, cracks or wall thickness deviations**.\n\nRead our **free white paper** to find out how CT inspections can be integrated into your quality assurance in **a temporary, mobile and cost-effective** way. \n\n[Secure your free white paper now](#whitepaper-formular)\n\n## Why CT inspection during series start-up?\n\n-   **Immediate defect identification:** Wall thickness deviations, burr formation, core residues and much more are reliably detected.\n-   **Mobile solution:** Container-based CT systems can be used directly on the line.\n-   **Scalable analysis:** Thanks to the cloud and AI, data can be analysed flexibly - regardless of location if required.\n-   **Automated OK/NOK selection:** Quick decisions without manual evaluation.\n\nOur CT inspection is therefore an ideal solution for production ramp-ups, pilot series, re-qualification and recalls. \n\n![Microvista auf der Österreichischen Gießereitagung in Leoben](https://www.microvista.de/wp-content/uploads/elementor/thumbs/Microvista-auf-der-Oesterreichischen-Giessereitagung-e1748953683503-r6rizq9nw6fm3qmom5fnug68oyjxqn73alucgzcvqw.webp)\n\nProf Dr Lutz Hagner (CEO, Microvista GmbH) speaks at the Austrian Foundry Conference in Leoben about innovative CT inspection solutions for series start-up.\n\n## Starting production without risk? Find out in the practical guide how industrial CT can help you\n\nThe white paper is based on a presentation given by **Prof. Dr. Lutz Hagner (CEO, Microvista GmbH)** at the **[67th Austrian Foundry Conference](https://www.ogi.at/de-de/156-67-oesterreichische-giessereitagung) in Leoben** – one of the most important industry meetings for casting and quality assurance experts in German-speaking countries.\n\nThe content has been edited for the white paper and supplemented with technical details and practical recommendations – ideal for anyone who wants to make a well-founded assessment of the use of temporary CT systems. \n\n![](https://www.microvista.de/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Whitepaper_Blog-Beitragsbild_EN.webp)\n\n### 📥 Download Whitepaper \"Temporary CT Inspection Secures Production Ramp-Ups\"\n\nPlease fill out the form to receive the free download link via email.\n\n  \n\n  \n\nYour data privacy is very important to us.
