  "markdown": "Components can be tested by using industrial computed tomography, but how does the complete process from customer inquiry to the finished scan evaluation work? We provide insights into CT-testing!\n\n## 1\\. Customer Inquiry & Individual Arrangements\n\nOnce a contact request has been received, our experts coordinate with the customer and discuss the individual requirements regarding the CT-testing process. It is important to clarify how many components are involved, what material they are made of and in which time frame they are to be scanned. If the scanning process has to be carried out particularly quickly, it is possible to book an express scan, which costs 30% more. In addition, other important information such as a component drawings or CAD of the component and the inspection specifications will have to be collected.\n\nMany of our customers wish to have Microvista take care of both the [quality control of the components](https://www.microvista.de/en/industrial-computed-tomography/services/ct-laboratory/) and the CT data evaluation. However, if you have your own CT, we can also offer you solely the [CT data evaluation](https://www.microvista.de/en/industrial-computed-tomography/services/ct-data-analysis/) via our cloud. If you need a CT system for a limited period of time at your production site at short notice, you can save yourself high investment costs & long waiting times with our [mobile CT solution](https://www.mobile-ct.eu/).\n\n![Piktogramm - Expertenberatung zur zerstörungsfreien Prüfung (industrielle CT & luftgekoppelter Ultraschall)](https://www.microvista.de/wp-content/uploads/elementor/thumbs/Piktogramm-Expertenberatung-zur-zerstorungsfreien-Prufung-industrielle-CT-luftgekoppelter-Ultraschall-qaw976rjm2m1kngpw01197280uldqi6235qyguo8ow.png)\n\n## 2\\. Quotation\n\nThrough close collaboration between our CT-experts and account managers, we prepare detailed and understandable proposals for our customers. Additionally, the documents for an NDA (Non-Disclosure Agreement) will be prepared in this step, if desired.\n\n## 3\\. Delivery of the Components\n\nAfter the customer has placed their order with us, the components are delivered to Microvista in Blankenburg. The transport is usually organized by our customers.\n\n## 4\\. Inspection\n\nNow the preparation of the inspection process begins. Our standard processing time (scan and evaluation) is 10 days. If a customer requests the express service. We scan the components immediately after their arrival and evaluate the results as soon as possible. Standard orders are first pre-sorted according to OK/NOK. Then we take a look inside the components with our advanced CT-Scanners.\n\nThe components are placed one after the other on an applicable setup in the CT for this purpose. All our CT experts have participated in radiation protection training and with closing the CT door, the scan can be performed. From the outside, adjustments to the scan process can be made on a separate panel at any time.\n\nInside the CT, a 3D image of the specimen is now created during the scan by sending X-rays through the object. The beams are picked up by a detector on the other side of the object. During scanning, the component under inspection rotates slowly to obtain a full 3D representation. The resulting raw data of the component is now captured in our software and used to create a 3D model of the object. This is then analyzed by our experts to identify any defects or weaknesses within the part.\n\n### For which materials is industrial CT inspection particularly suitable?\n\nIn general, industrial CT inspection of certain materials and components depends on various factors such as the material thickness, density and structure of the object to be inspected. Nevertheless, the following materials can be examined with an industrial CT scanner:\n\n-   Metals (e.g. aluminum, steel, titanium)\n-   Plastics and other synthetics\n-   Ceramics\n-   Composite materials (e.g. carbon fiber reinforced plastic (CFRP), glass fiber reinforced plastic (GFRP))\n-   Minerals ( e.g. rocks, ores)\n-   Electronic components (e.g. circuit boards, electronic chips)\n\n![Piktogramm - Industrielle Computertomographie zur Montage- & Fügekontrolle](https://www.microvista.de/wp-content/uploads/elementor/thumbs/Piktogramm-Industrielle-Computertomographie-zur-Montage-Fugekontrolle-qaw97f83bkxkfhe02ztfixcdbxl9j6wiuz2jl1o7b4.png)\n\n![Piktogramm - Defektanalyse mit industrielle Computertomographie zur Detektion von Poren, Lunkern & Einschlüssen](https://www.microvista.de/wp-content/uploads/elementor/thumbs/Piktogramm-Industrielle-Computertomographie-zur-Detektion-von-Poren-Lunkern-Einschlussen-Copy-qaw97bgqk8sf51jgoy6x8yaiye3soehligglnxts00.png)\n\n![Piktogramm - Industrielle Computertomographie zur Messung von Wanddicken](https://www.microvista.de/wp-content/uploads/elementor/thumbs/Piktogramm-Industrielle-Computertomographie-zur-Messung-von-Wanddicken-weis-1-qaw97dcexwuzs9gqdz06dxtg55uj3sp26prkmhqznk.png)\n\n![Piktogramm - Industrielle Computertomographie für Reverse Engineering (weiß)](https://www.microvista.de/wp-content/uploads/elementor/thumbs/Piktogramm-Industrielle-Computertomographie-fur-Reverse-Engineering-weis-1-qaw97aiwder4tfktufsaogj2d08fgpdv6bt46nv668.png)\n\n![Piktogram - Analyse von Hairpin Statoren](https://www.microvista.de/wp-content/uploads/elementor/thumbs/Piktogramm-Industrielle-Computertomographie-zur-Prufung-von-Hairpin-Statoren-Copy-qaw97g5xieyur3cmxi823f3txbgmqw0973q12bmt4w.png)\n\n![Piktogramm - Identifizieren von Grat, Kernreste & Späne in Hohlräumen](https://www.microvista.de/wp-content/uploads/elementor/thumbs/Piktogramm-Zerstorungsfreie-Prufung-auf-Grat-Kernreste-Spane-in-Hohlraumen-Copy-qaw97lsynf6kor4g0kntidolhmou12mn7vmxxzeg3k.png)\n\n## 5\\. Evaluation of the Industrial CT Inspection\n\nAt this stage, we evaluate the scan results and prepare a test report in accordance with the customer’s requirements. For this purpose, the customer gives us his specifications in advance: The analysis results can be presented using images and tables with measurement results or evaluations. If desired, the customer can also have access to the entire scan project. The results are encrypted and shared using our internal software solution.\n\n## 6\\. Returning the Components\n\nAfter the industrial CT inspection and evaluation, the components are transferred back to the customer. For this purpose, Microvista packs the components safely and efficiently. The return transport can be organized either by us or by the customer.\n\n## 7\\. Customer Satisfaction Assessment\n\nFor us, the order does not end with the sending of the invoice, but with getting to know of the customers satisfaction with our service. We want to know from our customers: What have we done well and where do we still need to improve? Here, there is the possibility of an anonymous evaluation based on a questionnaire or to leave a public feedback. We greatly value the feedback on our service and also the interaction with our customers during every step of the process.",
