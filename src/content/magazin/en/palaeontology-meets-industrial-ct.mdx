**Fossils are time capsules of Earth’s history** – they provide fascinating insights into long-gone worlds. To deepen these insights, the University of Halle is working with state-of-the-art technology: two employees from the Central Repository for Natural Science Collections (ZNS) recently visited Microvista to examine exhibits using industrial computed tomography (CT).

Several unusual skulls were scanned, including those of a water buffalo, a pygmy hippopotamus (Pygmy Hippopotamus) and a Hyrachyus, an extinct relative of the tapir. This fossil comes from the **Geisel Valley**, an important **fossil deposit** for Central European vertebrates from the Eocene epoch.

**The aim of the visit:** The high-resolution 3D data will enable the curator of the collection to analyse the brain morphology of these animals in detail – an important step towards a better understanding of phylogenetic developments and evolutionary patterns.

## The Geiselthal Collection at Martin Luther University Halle-Wittenberg

The Geisel Valley Collection at Martin Luther University Halle-Wittenberg comprises around 50,000 fossils from the former lignite mines in the Geisel Valley, approximately 20 km south-west of Halle (Saale). Over more than 80 years of excavation work (1920s to 2000s), **exceptionally well-preserved remains of subtropical** **flora and fauna** from the Eocene epoch have been recovered – including land-dwelling crocodiles, giant flightless birds and prehistoric horses. The state of preservation of many fossils is particularly remarkable: some are three-dimensional, with soft tissues, stomach contents and original colours. As the original sites are now flooded, no further finds are possible. The collection is considered **unique in the world and is protected as a “nationally valuable cultural asset”** – an important basis for current research on biodiversity in the Eocene climate optimum.

### Precision in manufacturing: overcoming challenges

The CT analysis of **large zoological fossils** poses unique challenges. In this case, the **high material density** of the fossilised skulls and the **considerable size** of some of the recent skulls were particularly challenging. However, these hurdles were mastered with ease using Microvista’s industrial CT technology: **within a very short time, detailed 3D models** were generated, which now serve as the basis for further scientific analysis.

## Microvista – Partner for Archaeology & Palaeontology

The successful collaboration with the University of Halle demonstrates once again that Microvista is not only at home in industrial quality assurance, but also a powerful partner for research institutions, museums and archaeological institutes.

Im CT-Labor von Microvista sind unter anderem folgende Leistungen möglich:

-   **Hochauflösende 3D-Scans** von organischen und anorganischen Materialien - ideal für Fossilien, Keramik, Metalle oder anthropologische Funde.

Skull of a wild water buffalo mounted in the CT scanner – the brain region of the exhibit was scanned within 36 minutes. The water buffalo is native to Asia and is kept as a farm animal.

Skull of a pygmy hippopotamus (Choeropsis liberiensis) – Pygmy hippopotamuses are a rare species native to the forests and swamps of West Africa.
