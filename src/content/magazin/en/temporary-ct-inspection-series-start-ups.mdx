**Production start, high cycle rate – and suddenly quality problems?** Whether a new component can be manufactured economically is particularly crucial in the early series phase. Industrial **computed tomography (CT)** offers fast, non-destructive insights into the interior of the component – especially when it comes to **invisible defects such as burrs, blowholes, cracks or wall thickness deviations**.

Read our **free white paper** to find out how CT inspections can be integrated into your quality assurance in **a temporary, mobile and cost-effective** way.

## Why CT inspection during series start-up?

-   **Immediate defect identification:** Wall thickness deviations, burr formation, core residues and much more are reliably detected.
-   **Mobile solution:** Container-based CT systems can be used directly on the line.
-   **Scalable analysis:** Thanks to the cloud and AI, data can be analysed flexibly - regardless of location if required.
-   **Automated OK/NOK selection:** Quick decisions without manual evaluation.

Our CT inspection is therefore an ideal solution for production ramp-ups, pilot series, re-qualification and recalls.

Prof Dr Lutz Hagner (CEO, Microvista GmbH) speaks at the Austrian Foundry Conference in Leoben about innovative CT inspection solutions for series start-up.

## Starting production without risk? Find out in the practical guide how industrial CT can help you

The white paper is based on a presentation given by **Prof. Dr. Lutz Hagner (CEO, Microvista GmbH)** at the **[67th Austrian Foundry Conference](https://www.ogi.at/de-de/156-67-oesterreichische-giessereitagung) in Leoben** – one of the most important industry meetings for casting and quality assurance experts in German-speaking countries.

The content has been edited for the white paper and supplemented with technical details and practical recommendations – ideal for anyone who wants to make a well-founded assessment of the use of temporary CT systems.
