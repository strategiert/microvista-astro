Microvista promises its customers economical and fast (serial) inspection. But how exactly can we keep this promise?

One factor in this promise involves fully **automated data evaluation**, which the CT experts at Microvista have been further optimising for years using **AI**. However, the evaluation service is only one of many steps required to successfully analyse a component for defects. In the CT inspection process, software plays an essential role at most points: in performing the CT scan, in reconstructing and evaluating the data, in generating reports, and in image processing and management. Alongside the hardware, the software thus plays a decisive role in how fast and high-resolution a component scan can be performed.

Microvista acquired the Yxlon FF85 CT from the manufacturer YxlonComet two years ago and is thus at the cutting edge of technology. With this CT, a wide variety of materials can be scanned and numerous analyses for defect determination can be carried out. This versatile CT has now been updated to an even more efficient **CT software – the VistaXPro** variant. This software package represents the most powerful package of all available Vista versions.

## This is possible with the CT software update

VistaXPro takes CT inspection to a new level. Above all, the software offers significant improvements in resolution and scan time. With **increased image quality, inspection time and data volumes are reduced**. Scans can now be performed **up to 5 times faster** and **up to 10 times higher resolution** can be achieved. Another decisive advantage of the update is that **laminography (“LayerScan”)** can now be used as an inspection method. Here, high-resolution layer images of flat components are created in a short time without requiring a 360° rotation.

## Investments for more quality

In order for Microvista to be able to solve its customers’ inspection tasks and achieve the best possible results, our services must be constantly optimised. For this, investments in R&D (e.g. AI projects for fully automated data evaluation) and powerful CT software are indispensable.
