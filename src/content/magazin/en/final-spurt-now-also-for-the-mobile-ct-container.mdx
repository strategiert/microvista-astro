## Impressions of the current status

The heart of the mobile CT is already finished. Now it is a matter of completing its shell. That’s why we stepped on the gas again at the end of last year to push ahead with the construction of the CT container. In addition to the CT, this will also house a technical and operating room. Before the marriage of CT and container, the installation of the lead cladding for radiation protection will still be an important step. In addition to this, air-conditioning technology will also be installed in the container.  We are currently looking forward to the delivery date in February.
