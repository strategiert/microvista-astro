## The overview: This is new!

### Design & structure

The Microvista website has received a technical design upgrade for the year 2022. In addition, the structure has been adapted so that the various topics are easier to find. Now you can find information about the entire range of industrial computed tomography on the Microvista website.

### [Newsletter & blog](/newsletter)

The new newsletter lets you know when there are new blog posts. In addition, you will receive supplementary information on current topics such as mobile CT or get the chance to win special benefits. For example, newsletter subscribers could secure free tickets to Euroguss 2022, where they could win an iPad at the Microvista booth.

### [Questionnaire](/fragebogen)

You don't know whether Microvista has the right offer for your testing challenge?! In this case, we have developed a questionnaire with which you can quickly and easily find out whether Microvista can help you. If so, you will find out which method Microvista proposes before you contact us.

### [Book a Microsoft Teams meeting in the calendar](https://outlook.office365.com/owa/calendar/MicrovistazerstrungsfreiePrfung@netco.de/bookings/)

Until now, you could only start an enquiry via a contact form, email or telephone. Now you have the direct option of blocking a meeting on a selected topic in our employees' calendar so that you can get face-to-face advice.
