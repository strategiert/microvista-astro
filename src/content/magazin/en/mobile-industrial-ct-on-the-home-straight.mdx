## The heart of the mobile industrial CT completed

The realisation of the mobile CT SCANEXPRESS was launched with [Fraunhofer EZRT](https://www.iis.fraunhofer.de/de/ff/zfp.html). So that automated quality assurance will come to Microvista’s customers in the near future. And this:

-   Without high investment costs
-   Without long waiting times
-   Only as long as there is demand

In the meantime, the system has already been transported in a radiation protection cabin, so that the first CT scans are currently being carried out at Fraunhofer. The project is now entering the hot phase.

## Quality assurance

Parallel to the first test scans with the mobile CT, Microvista is rebuilding to make room for maintenance and set-up purposes. Before each delivery to the customer, the mobile CT is put through its paces to ensure that everything runs smoothly in operation. In addition, it is adapted to the individual examination task. This means that a quick system calibration can be carried out after shipment. The result is a real-time evaluation with AI and an automatic report after each inspection.
