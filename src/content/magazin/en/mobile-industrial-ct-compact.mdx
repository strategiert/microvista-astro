Quality assurance is an indispensable part of modern production processes. With ScanExpress, the first mobile industrial computed tomography (CT) system, Microvista introduced a groundbreaking solution for flexible and efficient quality control in the field of non-destructive testing (NDT). Following the great success of this system, Microvista is now taking the next step with the ScanExpress 2.0, an optimized version tailored even better to the needs of the industry. 

## Collaboration for Innovation: Microvista and Fraunhofer EZRT

The first ScanExpress was the result of close collaboration with the renowned Fraunhofer EZRT. This partnership enabled the integration of cutting-edge technologies into a user-friendly mobile CT system. Success came quickly: the original ScanExpress was fully booked months in advance. To meet the growing demand, Microvista and Fraunhofer EZRT jointly developed the enhanced version: the ScanExpress Compact. 

## New Features of the ScanExpress Compact

The ScanExpress Compact sets new standards in mobile quality control. By eliminating the need for an operator room, the system is significantly more space-saving and easier to integrate. An innovative design enables barrier-free loading outside the container, simplifying deployment in diverse production environments. These improvements make the system even more flexible and efficient.

## Advantages of Mobile Industrial CT

The ScanExpress offers numerous benefits specifically designed to address the challenges of modern industry: 

-   No Logistical Effort: The CT system operates directly at the production line, eliminating shipping times and costs. Blocked batches can be inspected and released immediately. 

-   Fully Automated Analysis: Thanks to automated evaluation, customers receive precise inspection results immediately after testing. The system is suitable for both sample inspections and full component examinations. 

-   Flexibility and Mobility: The ScanExpress can be rented as needed, with extendable options—eliminating the need for high upfront investment costs. 
-   Sustainability: Non-destructive testing reduces waste and conserves resources by avoiding the destruction of components. This not only increases efficiency but also reduces the environmental footprint. 

## Applications: Perfect for Complex Requirements

Industries such as automotive manufacturing particularly benefit from the ScanExpress. Components like stators, batteries, exhaust manifolds, or cylinder heads often require high-precision 3D analysis to ensure the highest quality standards. The ScanExpress delivers reliable and rapid results, optimizing production processes and enhancing safety.
