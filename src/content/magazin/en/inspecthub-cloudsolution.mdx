Introducing our cloud-based platform for industrial CT data: The Microvista _INSPECT_**_HUB._**

With this cloud solution, we are creating new possibilities for consistent, secure and convenient collaboration – especially for large quantities. The InspectHub has been specially developed for the requirements of series inspection and offers you access to relevant status and evaluation data at all times. 

## All features at a glance

Track the current status of the CT inspection directly online: The number of components already scanned and the respective progress of the assessment – whether manual or automated – is displayed in real time. This means you always have an overview and are aware of the quantities of OK and NOK assessed test specimens. 

### Real-time insight into your testing processes

### Transparent evaluation results

**Depending on the agreement, the results of the component evaluation are available including visualisation** - as a single image or a complete image stack. This creates maximum transparency, speeds up internal coordination and provides quick feedback on key error areas.

### Data export and automatic reports

_**Learn more →**_

**In addition to the manual download of evaluation data lists, an automatic e-mail dispatch is available for larger inspection volumes:** You receive a daily summary of the current scan results as a report - conveniently and without additional effort.

### Data security according to the TISAX standard
