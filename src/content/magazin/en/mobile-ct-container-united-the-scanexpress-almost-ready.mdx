After the final work in the area of radiation protection and interior work on the container of the mobile CT system was carried out in the last few weeks, the mobile CT was placed in the container last week – a major milestone in the overall construction process of the SCANEXPRESS, on which three teams (CT Cage, Container, Cloud Software) worked in cooperation with Fraunhofer (Link: Homepage  [Fraunhofer-Gesellschaft](https://www.fraunhofer.de/))

## Just married - this is how the wedding went

During this “wedding” of CT and CT container, all cables have already been connected so that the mobile CT is ready for use.

Here you can see the installation of the mobile CT into the container in a time-lapse video:

## What is the remaining work to be done now?

In the coming week, the container of the mobile CT system will be sealed. In addition, the first radiation protection and function tests will be carried out. In week 6, the SCANEXPRESS is scheduled to arrive at Microvista in Blankenburg. There, the container will be covered from the outside before it starts its journey to the pilot customer.
