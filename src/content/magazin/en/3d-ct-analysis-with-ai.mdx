Today, high-performance motors have to deliver **more power in a smaller space** – and work more efficiently at the same time. This development poses new and demanding challenges for quality control in production. Conventional inspection methods are reaching their limits. A pioneering solution: **3D computed tomography (CT) combined with artificial intelligence (AI)**.

At **Microvista**, we offer customised solutions for **3D CT analysis in industrial quality assurance** – especially for the requirements of the engine industry. 

## Compact design and thermal management: a balancing act for motor technology

In order to increase efficiency and performance, manufacturers are increasingly focussing on **compact design and lightweight construction**. This often leads to a reduction in cubic capacity while maintaining or even increasing performance. However, **thermal management** plays a decisive role in these smaller, powerful engines in particular.

The challenge: **cooling ducts with very small cross-sections** must be manufactured flawlessly in order to avoid heat build-up. Even the smallest burrs or residues impair the coolant flow and therefore the performance and service life of the engine. 

## 3D CT and AI: high-precision inspection for maximum quality

Industrial **3D computed tomography** makes it possible to fully X-ray components and generate precise 3D models. In combination with **AI-supported analysis**, this opens up completely new dimensions in defect detection:

### Automated detection

Identification of burrs, blowholes or core residues using state-of-the-art technology and reduction of the error rate.

### Volume-based analysis

3D result data (e.g. pore volume) go far beyond what visual or X-ray inspections can  
achieve.

### Fast test cycles

The evaluation time no longer restricts throughput and thus enables more efficient testing.

## Flexible solutions: Mobile CT inspection systems such as the ScanExpress

Another highlight is the **ScanExpress** from Microvista – a **mobile CT solution** that can be quickly and easily integrated into existing production environments. Ideal for production start-ups, pilot series or blocked batches, our customers benefit from: 

### Flexibility

... through mobile usability

### Fast availability

... without large investments

### Customisation

... of the CT software on the component pattern

The ScanExpress is available in two sizes: the classic Long version and, since last year, the Compact version.
