## Microvista GmbH strengthens management team: Dr. Robin Höhne and Prof. Dr. Lutz Hagner form dual leadership

_Doctor of Engineering joins company founder in joint management – focus on mobile CT technology and AI-supported solutions_

Blankenburg (Harz), 3 November 2025 – Microvista GmbH is restructuring its management team: On 1 October 2025, Dr. Robin Höhne will take over the position of Chief Executive Officer and, together with company founder Prof. Dr Lutz Hagner, will form the dual leadership of the management team. This will distribute the management of the company between two experienced leaders in order to specifically strengthen Microvista’s growth and technological development. The founder and long-standing managing director Prof. Dr. Lutz Hagner has developed the company into a leading provider of industrial computed tomography solutions in Europe.

## Experience in digitisation and quality assurance

Dr. Höhne holds a doctorate in engineering and brings extensive expertise in industrial quality assurance, digitalisation and strategic corporate development to the table. Under joint management, Microvista aims to accelerate the further development of its _**SCAN**EXPRESS_ mobile CT technology, automated software solutions and cloud platforms.

‘I look forward to continuing Microvista’s success story together with our strong team – with the aim of making industrial computed tomography even more efficient, accessible and sustainable,’ says Dr. Höhne.

## Innovative technologies for non-destructive testing

Under Prof. Dr. Hagner, Microvista has established itself as an innovation driver in non-destructive material testing. In addition to stationary CT services, the company has set new standards with mobile CT systems and AI-supported evaluation solutions. The mobile technology enables measurements to be taken directly at the customer’s premises, reducing transport costs and downtime.

With its new dual leadership, Microvista is strengthening its position as a leading provider of industrial computed tomography solutions in Europe.
