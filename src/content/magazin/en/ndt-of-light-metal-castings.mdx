## Non Destructive Testing of low tolerances for complex light metal castings

Light metals such as aluminum, titan and magnesium are in high demand, especially in the automotive industry, as complex components can be manufactured with a high degree of automation & recyclability. However, production is complicated: The components are more fragile and have lower tolerances during casting & processing. The susceptibility to defective components is therefore higher in light metal casting. Due to the strict requirements in the automotive industry, quality assurance is essential. Microvista has developed automated processes for this so that even large quantities can be tested within a very short time. Microvista is there for you to inspect your components and offers the following CT inspection services:

-   Focus analysis: pores, cavities and blowholes
-   Extended porosity/inclusion analysis
-   Structural analyses: burrs & core residues, inclusions & cracks
-   Dimensional measurement: Wall thicknesses, volumes & surfaces

### Challenge:

The control arm fixes & aligns the wheel. In doing so, it stabilizes it against lateral forces & ensures safe straight-line driving. While driving, it is exposed to high tensile & compressive forces, especially when starting off & braking. This is why the stability of the wishbone is so important. Pores & cavities in the casting can impair this & and reduce the resistance of this safety-relevant component.  

### Possible consequences:

If a control arm is defective, not only can the tires wear unevenly, but damage can also occur to other components such as axle parts & steering. It can even cause the entire vehicle body to sag. If the wishbone cracks or breaks, the result would be a life-threatening loss of control of the vehicle.

### Advantages of CT Testing

Industrial CT can help to identify failure hotspots & thus helps to monitor FMEA risks. Process improvements can be achieved by assigning the defect information to the casting date & -layer and core boxes or molds.
