In pharmaceutical production and medical technology, quality assurance is not only a regulatory requirement, but also a key prerequisite for product safety and patient protection. Precision, integrity and completeness are particularly important for solid dosage forms such as tablets and complex packaging solutions such as blister packs – both externally and internally.

This is where industrial computed tomography (CT) shows its strengths: as a non-destructive, high-resolution testing method for detecting defects and deviations from standards. 

## CT as a versatile testing tool for solid dosage forms and packaging

Industrial CT technology makes it possible to precisely analyse both the external shape and internal structure of pharmaceutical products – completely non-destructively.

This involves reconstructing a three-dimensional volume model that can be evaluated using special software.

# Application examples

Quality control of packaging

CT scans can be used to check blister packs or cardboard packaging for **completeness, dimensional accuracy and tightness without opening them**. This makes it possible to check whether all tablets are present and intact, whether blister packs are damaged or whether the boxes are correctly filled. 

Defect detection in solid dosage form

**Typical errors that can be detected by CT are:**

-   Cracks in the tablet core
-   Voids or cavities
-   Delamination in the coating
-   Breaks in applicators or packaging components 

3D reconstruction & digital documentatio

The **3D models** generated from the CT data enable **detailed and reproducible error analysis**, even retrospectively.

This offers advantages in terms of audits, traceability, documentation in accordance with the Medical Device Regulation (MDR) and the optimisation of manufacturing processes.

## Conclusion: CT as a key technology for the pharmaceutical industry

**Industrial computed tomography has established itself as a valuable tool for quality assurance and fault analysis in pharmaceutical and medical technology.**

Packaging and drug forms are inspected completely, non-destructively and in 3D, opening up new possibilities in process control and product development. Particularly in view of stricter regulatory requirements (e.g. due to the Medical Devices Regulation), industrial computed tomography is a future-proof component for digital and seamless quality assurance.
