Defects in production batches in the automotive industry often result in the entire batch being lost, as the search for the cause of the defect is considered costly – however, saving the partial batch is not only **quick and easy**, but can also be achieved **cost-effectively** with the help of non-destructive testing (NDT).  
With this method, materials and structures are checked for defects without damaging the object to be tested. NDT is often used in the production of vehicle parts and components, but also in the inspection of vehicles that have already been produced to ensure that they meet quality and safety standards and do not pose a risk to road traffic.  
At Microvista, a wide variety of inspection tasks for the automotive industry are solved fully automatically.

## What are the advantages of non-destructive testing?

Microvista uses industrial computed tomography (CT) to check the quality of components from the automotive industry. In addition to this method, air-coupled ultrasound, for example, also counts as a non-destructive testing method. Compared to manual quality management processes, both methods have significant advantages: With these methods, materials and structures are inspected for defects without damaging the object to be inspected. CFRP is often used in the production of vehicle parts and components, but also in the inspection of already produced vehicles to ensure that they meet quality and safety standards & do not pose a risk to road traffic. At Microvista, a wide variety of inspection tasks for the automotive industry are solved fully automatically.

### Non-destructive

The procedures make it possible to examine objects without having to destroy or disassemble them. This is particularly advantageous when it comes to expensive or sensitive components.

### High resolution & precision

CT and ultrasound technology create very detailed images of objects that make even small structures visible and thus reveal defects in components. With air-coupled ultrasound and the associated inspection system YoUScan!, components are scanned directly on the line using air ultrasound and classified into IO/NIO. [Learn more about air-coupled ultrasound here.](https://www.youscan.eu/en/)

### Fast results

Industrial computed tomography and ultrasonic testing examine objects in the shortest possible time - the results are usually available immediately. This speeds up the quality control process.

### Numerous areas of application

CT is used in many branches of industry. In addition to the automotive industry, the aerospace, mechanical engineering and medical technology sectors also make use of the non-destructive testing method. Ultrasonic testing examines a variety of materials, including metals, plastics and even lubricants.

### Low costs

Equipment for CFRP is expensive, but it usually pays for itself in the time saved and the improvement in the quality of the components produced. At Microvista, you can either [send us your components](/en/industrial-computed-tomography/services/ct-laboratory/) and we will check them at low cost or you can use our [mobile CT](https://www.mobile-ct.eu) and check your components directly on your doorstep. Do you have your own CT? Then we would be happy to take over the data evaluation for you - find out more about our automated process [here](/en/industrial-computed-tomography/services/ct-data-analysis/). The purchase of the YoUScan! air-ultrasonic inspection system incl. YoUVision! evaluation software also has low costs. If you are thinking about purchasing your own YouScan! inspection system, you can find more information [here](https://www.youscan.eu/en/).
