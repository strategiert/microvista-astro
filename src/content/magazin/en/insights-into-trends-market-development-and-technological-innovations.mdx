## Current market & forecast for the development of industrial computed tomography

The global market for industrial computed tomography (CT) is experiencing significant growth. Market estimates for the years 2022 to 2024 range from USD 502 million to USD 645.3 million. This market is forecast to grow to a size of USD 773.45 million to USD 1,116.5 million between 2029 and 2030. The compound annual growth rate (CAGR) is around 7.4% to 9.03% (Grand View Research, Inc., 2023; Mordor Intelligence, 2024).

The increasing use of additive manufacturing techniques in various industries such as automotive, aerospace, defense and electronics is driving this development. Additive manufacturing, also known as 3D printing, enables the production of complex designs and structures that are expensive and difficult to produce using conventional methods. Industrial CT scanners test the strength and properties of such structures without damaging the product (Grand View Research, Inc, 2023).

## Advantages of industrial CT

One of the advantages of industrial CT is the non-destructive testing of components. There are a variety of different CT systems that enable the digitization of microscopically small test specimens with high resolution (nm range) up to components and complete systems the size of a vehicle. Using specialized evaluation software, various inspections such as pore analysis, defect detection and assembly analysis can be carried out on the basis of CT digitization. CT inspection can be used to advantage in the development process and quality management for:

-   faster product development,
-   increased product quality and thus
-   a reduced risk of product recalls and
-   a reduced reject rate for blocked components.

## Market

The market is divided into the devices and services segments. The equipment segment dominates with a revenue share of 51.8% in 2022 and is expected to grow at a CAGR of 7.1% during the forecast period (Grand View Research, Inc, 2023). Key innovation drivers here are CT software developments such as ZEISS Automated Defect Detection, which uses AI for automated defect analysis (Carl Zeiss Industrial Metrology, LLC., n.d.). The services segment, for which the higher growth rate of 7.7% is expected, comprises inspection, support, maintenance and consulting services. Due to the high capital intensity of CT scanners, companies are increasingly outsourcing services to third-party providers (Grand View Research, Inc, 2023).

## Innovations in industrial CT

### Service innovation

Microvista GmbH has developed a flexible and mobile CT system in collaboration with the EZRT at Fraunhofer IIS. The system can be easily and quickly integrated into production processes and is offered as a rental system for non-destructive testing in phases of increased inspection effort. The inspection process is fully automated (CT scan, reconstruction, evaluation) and is supplied with customized evaluation software. This concept enables rapid feedback on product quality directly at the production site, thereby reducing the costs and logistical effort of the CT inspection. Thanks to the automatic, AI-supported evaluation, the system is ideally suited for series testing or series-accompanying tests (Fraunhofer Institute for Integrated Circuits IIS, 2023; Microvista GmbH, n.d.-b).

### Device innovations

In 2018, the Fraunhofer Institute put the first robot-based CT system into operation at car manufacturer BMW. This technological innovation represents a significant advance in industrial computed tomography and has the potential to change the way complex components are examined and analyzed in the automotive industry (Fraunhofer Institute for Integrated Circuits IIS, 2018). With this technology, which is used in the pilot plant at the BMW Research and Innovation Center, four robots can take several thousand sectional images of a vehicle prototype in the micrometre range. This enables precise three-dimensional analysis without having to dismantle the vehicle (Beutnagel, 2018). 

### Connection between device and service innovation

In the case of at-line or in-line systems in the plants of OEMs or suppliers, there may be evaluation bottlenecks due to a lack of personnel or personnel cost savings, or there may be special evaluation challenges where standard software reaches its limits. This is where providers such as Microvista GmbH can help with customized automated evaluation via the cloud (Microvista GmbH, n.d.-a).

## Scanning techniques

Surface and cone beam CT dominate the market. The area beam CT segment had a market share of 44.1% in 2022 and is expected to achieve a CAGR of 7.3%. Cone beam CT is expected to have a higher CAGR of 7.9%. Cone beam CT is suitable for scanning electronic components and medium-sized castings and offers advantages due to shorter scanning times (Grand View Research, Inc, 2023).

Computer laminography is particularly suitable for flat or planar components, e.g. for electronic circuit boards, the examination of rotor blades for helicopters and wind turbines or flat fiber composite components. 12 Due to the ever-increasing size of components, the switch to renewable energies and the ever-increasing demand for electronic components, computer laminography is expected to play an important role alongside industrial CT (Maisl et al., 2010). 

## Development in fields of application

The defect detection and inspection segment, which held a market share of 25.0% in 2022, will have the highest CAGR of 8.6%. The assembly analysis segment, increasingly used in the automotive, aerospace and electronics industries, is expected to grow at a CAGR of 7.2% (Grand View Research, Inc, 2023). 

## Development by sector

### Demand in the automotive industry for industrial CT

The automotive industry dominated in 2022 with a market share of 26.6%. A CAGR of 7.8% is expected until 2030. Industrial CT systems are used in various phases of the production process (Grand View Research, Inc, 2023). 

### Demand in the electronics segment for industrial CT

The electronics segment is expected to exhibit the fastest CAGR of 8.5% as CT scanning is increasingly used to examine internal parts in the electronics industry (Grand View Research, Inc, 2023). 

### Demand in the aerospace sector for industrial CT

In the aerospace industry, the increasing demand for precise assessments of complex parts at high temperatures has driven the CT business. CT is used for the examination of parts such as welded pipes, aluminum castings, and turbine blades, contributing to the growth of the market (Grand View Research, Inc, 2023). 

## Regional differences in the market

Asia Pacific dominated the market in 2022 with a revenue share of 33.6% and is expected to register the fastest growth rate of 8.2%. North America expects a significant CAGR of 7.6%. In Europe, stringent safety regulations and preventive maintenance of industrial equipment are driving growth, especially in the automotive and aerospace industries (Grand View Research, Inc., 2023; Mordor Intelligence, 2024). 

## Summary

Industrial computed tomography is becoming an indispensable tool in various industries, driven by technological advances and an increasing demand for precise and reliable defect detection and quality control. Innovations in the field of computed tomography are essentially addressing the challenges posed by a greater variety of scanning options, faster and more flexible CT systems and adapted service models. With the further development of additive manufacturing techniques and the growing need for precise inspection methods, the market for industrial CT is expected to continue to grow strongly.
