## Experts in the testing of automotive parts

Non-destructive testing of components using industrial CT has been an integral part of quality assurance in the automotive industry for many years. Manufacturers know that quick feedback in the event of deviations in product quality saves costs. In times of lightweight construction, the transition to electromobility and increased efforts to reduce CO2, this is all the more true.

Microvista’s service helps with a wide range of challenges, e.g. when it comes to systematically uncovering and eliminating the causes of errors or when batches cannot be released due to potential defects.

Prevention is often better than cure. With our fast and reliable CT service, you can keep an eye on everything. This far-sightedness saves you time and money across the entire production process.

## Practical example: E-mobility drivetrain

### Challenge:

Prevent impermissibly thin walls in the cooling jacket 

### Possible consequences:

Breakdown at full load and risk of field failures occurring 

### Advantages of the CT test:

Rapid detection of fault hotspots to stabilize production processes through fully automated and cost-effective CT evaluation

### Challenge:

High mechanical load of laser joints (e.g. welding of hairpins or contacting systems) 

### Possible consequences:

Field failures with possible recalls due to systematic deviations

### Advantages of the CT test:

Process reliability and stability thanks to regular spot checks including rapid automatic determination of the most important quality parameters

### Challenge:

Holey short-circuit rings and shrink plugs on their connecting rods in asynchronous motors

### Possible consequences:

Malfunction in use 

### Advantages of the CT test:

Checking the mechanical stability of the laminated core

## Practical example: combustion engine drivetrain

### Challenge:

Fate of inorganic binders in cavities 

### Possible consequences:

Functional impairment due to adhering core residues in cooling ducts (failure of pumps and auxiliary units possible due to detachment of these) 

### Advantages of the CT test:

Non-destructive testing can even be carried out on a fully assembled motor for acute damage limitation or as a preventive measure in the event of suspicion (FMEA)

### Challenge:

High technological requirements for wall thicknesses and mechanical load capacity due to increased motor power and simultaneous mass reduction

### Possible consequences:

Failure to achieve machine capability (risk of overheating and wall breakthroughs under load) 

### Advantages of the CT test:

Dimensional inspection of individual and critical  features with rapid OK/NOK assessment

### Challenge:

Commissioning a new production batch after a long time – does the mold really match the current CAD?

### Possible consequences:

Lost production (detection of missing contour only in final assembly) 

### Advantages of the CT test:

Quick detection of unwanted deviations and other shortcomings  through CAD target/actual comparison (needs-based maintenance of core boxes and molds possible)

## Testing of structural components

The production of structural components is technologically challenging, as hybrid structures, e.g. made of different metals and fiber composites, are created using sophisticated joints, and mechanical parameters may not be achieved, resulting in malfunctions in critical components. Non-destructive testing with CT can be used in the automotive industry to gain feedback for process improvement and to sort out faulty parts. 

## Assembly and joint inspection with industrial CT

Your product is not working and you can’t find the reason? Are you unsure whether the assembly was carried out correctly? Disassembly is not permitted, unsuitable for analysis or too time-consuming?

Without disassembly, completeness, correct fit and sufficiently good joint can be checked.
