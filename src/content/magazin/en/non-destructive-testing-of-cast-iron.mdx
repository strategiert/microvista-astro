## Iron casting - opportunity & challenge for lightweight construction

Lightweight construction does not automatically mean “light metal”, as light metals cannot be used at high temperatures and pressures. Thin-walled cast iron or steel and innovative, bionic design are used to create components that can compete with functional elements made of light metal.

Mass savings and good mechanical properties are accompanied by high technological challenges. Anyone who is ahead of the game here can also enter the competitive market for lightweight safety components as an iron caster. Process monitoring based on meaningful inspection data enables high quality and ultimately more profit. Non-destructive testing of cast iron with CT can help here.

## Procedure for non-destructive testing of iron casting

### Series testing

Complicated components in high-quality end products? Major damage caused by quality defects that far exceed the manufacturing costs? Safety-relevant components that require a 100% inspection?

In these cases, fast, low-cost & non-destructive testing of cast iron is required. Industrial CT makes this possible. Thanks to ready-made process & automation modules, high levels of maturity can be achieved quickly & at low cost in the inspection process.

#### Inspection in the Microvista test laboratory

![Series testing in the Microvista test laboratory](/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Series-testing-in-the-Microvista-test-laboratory.webp)

\*Note: Scan within 24h only by arrangement & depending on the number of parts

#### Automated evaluation of your CT scan via Microvista Cloud

Load CT scans into the Microvista Cloud & have them analyzed automatically. Save time as time-consuming manual evaluation is not required.

#### Mobile CT solution

You only need a CT inspection temporarily & don’t want to ship your components for an inspection? Then rent a CT system only for as long as you need it! Microvista’s unique mobile CT solution saves you high investment costs & long waiting times.

### Sampling

Inspection required for acute problems in production? Customer returns? Qualification of product changes?

Reliable information on product condition, inclusions, cavities or other properties must be available quickly in order to react in good time and draw the right conclusions. Expertise in the planning and execution of the CT scan as well as in the subsequent analysis are crucial for this.

#### Inspection in the Microvista test laboratory

\*\*Note: Turnaround time by arrangement, usually < 3 days for standard tasks.

#### Expert evaluation of your CT scan via Microvista Cloud

You have your own CT, but you don’t have the resources to analyze your individual part scans? The CT experts at Microvista will take care of your evaluations. Whether it’s initial sampling or requalification of components on the basis of relevant standards or detailed analysis of defect hotspots. Start saving time now.

## Recognizing differences between simulation & reality in iron casting with industrial CT

A designer’s imagination and the results of the simulation do not always match reality.

Cross-sectional areas of ducts must lie within specified tolerances, otherwise the hoped-for performance will fall short of the designed expectations.
