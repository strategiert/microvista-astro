With the ScanExpress—the world’s only mobile industrial computed tomography (CT) scanner—Microvista has set new standards in non-destructive testing. This innovative solution enables companies to perform highly precise 3D scans on-site, offering an unprecedented level of flexibility in quality assurance. The ScanExpress is available in two versions—the Long Version and the Compact Version. But which version is best suited for which application? In this article, we compare the two versions and highlight their respective strengths.

## 

**The Long Version of the ScanExpress: Maximum Performance and Versatility**

The larger variant of the ScanExpress is designed for maximum performance and versatility. This version offers the highest degree of flexibility for inspecting large and complex components. Here are the key features and benefits of the Long Version:

1.  **Large Scanning Volume:**  
    The Long Version features an expanded maximum envelope of 798 mm and a maximum height of 1680 mm, making it ideal for inspecting large components and assemblies. This advantage allows even very large and complex structures—such as engine housings, transmission parts, or battery modules—to be examined effectively.
2.  **X-ray Energy and Detail Accuracy:**  
    With a maximum X-ray energy of 2250 W (225 kV and 10 mA), the Long Version is particularly suited for testing thick and dense materials such as copper, iron, titanium, and ceramics. This energy is sufficient to penetrate thick-walled materials and detect defects hidden deep within the structure. Simultaneously, the Long Version offers a minimum voxel size of 36 µm, which enables high detail resolution and makes it ideal for inspecting small and complex features within large components.
3.  **Integrated Control Room:**  
    The Long Version is equipped with an integrated control room that allows operators to conveniently and safely control and monitor the entire inspection process. This feature is especially advantageous when the system is placed outside the production hall.

**The Compact Version of the ScanExpress: Compact Efficiency and Precision**

The Compact Version of the ScanExpress has been designed to deliver maximum efficiency and precision in a more compact format. This version is particularly suitable for companies that regularly perform on-site scans but do not have the space or need for the larger Long Version. The key features and benefits of the Compact Version include:

1.  **Compact Size and Reduced Footprint:**  
    With a smaller container size (2896 x 2438 x 6058 mm), the Compact Version is roughly half as long. This is achieved by positioning the control panel directly behind the container door, next to the CT’s automatic sliding doors. Consequently, this version requires significantly less space and is ideal for cramped production environments or sites with limited space.
2.  **Inspecting Smaller Components with Denser, Thicker Materials:**  
    The Compact Version has a smaller maximum envelope of 580 mm. However, its maximum X-ray energy is slightly higher at 4800 W (320 kV and 15 mA) compared to the Long Version. This increased energy allows for deeper penetration of denser and thicker materials, such as batteries or thick-walled metal parts. To harness this higher energy, a larger focal spot of the radiation source and a more robust detector are necessary, resulting in a larger minimum voxel size of 50 µm. This compromise leads to more effective penetration of dense materials and, in many cases, an optimized scan time. It is also possible to reduce artifacts and achieve clear image quality when ultra-high detail resolution is not the top priority—a sensible trade-off in many practical industrial scenarios.

## 

**Which Version is the Right Choice?**

The decision between the Long Version and the Compact Version of the ScanExpress depends on the specific requirements and application areas of your company:

-   **Long Version:** The best choice for companies that require high resolution to detect small defects in large, complex components.
-   **Compact Version:** The ideal solution for companies that need higher penetration power for denser materials. The higher X-ray energy and the correspondingly larger voxel size are optimal for applications where inspecting thick, heavy materials is paramount, even if the finest detail resolution is not the highest priority.

## 

**Conclusion: Maximum Flexibility and Performance for Diverse Needs**

With the Long and Compact Versions of the world’s only mobile industrial CT, Microvista offers two powerful options that cater to the diverse requirements of modern manufacturing companies.
