In industrial production, **even the smallest deviations in the production process or in raw materials** can **lead to the precautionary blocking of entire batches**. As soon as a potential fault is identified, all associated components are blocked – regardless of whether they are actually all affected. The result: a large number of components are suddenly unused in the warehouse, even though they were firmly scheduled for customer orders. 

## The problem: Production downtime due to unclear error situation

The precautionary blocking of entire batches often leads to significant disruptions in the material flow. Without a quick and targeted error analysis, **delays in delivery, additional storage costs and potential contractual penalties** arise. In these cases, companies need a solution that quickly identifies non-conforming components and speeds up the re-release of flawless components. 

## The goal: Quick clarification of quality deviations with minimal effort

For effective decision-making, it is essential to determine promptly which components are actually faulty. This involves a sensible **compromise between accuracy of analysis, time expenditure and cost-effectiveness**. This is because complex individual tests cost valuable time, while imprecise procedures increase the risk of incorrect deliveries. 

## The solution: Technically sound express service for fault analysis

Our specialised express service for blocked batches offers fast, image-based inspection and classification of affected components. We rely on automated image-based inspection systems that are specifically tailored to the type of defect in question. 

-   Our approach is based on the following guideline:
-   **Image quality only as high as necessary:** The spatial resolution is chosen to enable reliable and efficient defect detection - unnecessarily time-consuming scans are eliminated.
-   **Optimized inspection algorithms:** Inspection is based on typical defect patterns - reliably and with high repeatability.
-   **Resource conservation:** The pragmatic use of our software for automated evaluation of CT data reduces time and costs without compromising the quality of the inspection.

## Typical fault patterns and applied test methods

Our system for rapid fault analysis reliably recognises a large number of frequently occurring production faults: 

### Geometric deviations

**Dimensional overruns or deformations are recognised by comparison with CAD models and taking permissible tolerances into account.**

### Material defects

**Inclusions or blowholes are recognised by AI algorithms and assessed according to their size and location.**

### Assembly defects

**Missing parts, incorrect positions or positions are reliably detected using comparison methods (e.g. golden part) or AI-supported image analysis.**

The **respective test strategy is customised** – depending on the component geometry, urgency and defect pattern. In this way, we guarantee an optimum ratio of effort, speed and informative value of the results. **Microvista has a toolbox full of software modules that can be linked together and** enable **a mature, fully or semi-automated process** for rapid implementation of the testing strategy.

## The result: fast approval, stabilised processes

With our technical express service, blocked batches can be quickly released or specifically sorted out – based on clear, reliable data. This relieves your warehouse, prevents unnecessary production downtime and secures delivery deadlines. 

## Conclusion: Technically sophisticated error analysis saves time and costs

Our solution combines error detection, process reliability and efficiency – especially for situations with high time pressure and an uncertain error situation. With targeted quality inspection based on modern image processing systems, we support you in **avoiding production downtimes** and **keeping your supply chain stable**.

Rely on quick decisions in the event of quality deviations – with our express service for industrial fault analysis.
