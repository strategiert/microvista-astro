The automotive industry is facing constantly growing challenges and must adapt to changing requirements. A central issue here is the transition to **electric and internal combustion engines with hydrogen**. A key component in engine construction will still be **casting technology**. Depending on the casting process, cast products are susceptible to defects in different ways, which is why it is essential to check the quality of expensive and/or safety-relevant components. One way to do this non-destructively is computed tomography (CT). However, there are some reservations about CT inspection, as it is often assumed to be expensive, time-consuming and to require qualified personnel. Microvista GmbH has already taken on all these challenges with its [service portfolio](/en/industrial-computed-tomography/services) in the past. In order to make CT testing even more attractive as a non-destructive testing method, the [SCANEXPERSS](https://www.mobile-ct.eu/) was developed by Microvista as a rentable mobile CT solution. Among other things, this makes a CT available at short notice at manageable cost when there is a need. This is ideal, for example, to **speed up development, to get a grip on a process that is not capable and controlled at the SOP or in the case of blocked batches**.

## Microvista with the SCANEXPRESS at the 12th VDI Conference

In order to make this innovative world first known to as many foundries and OEMs as possible, Microvista exhibited its CT at the 12th [VDI conference](https://www.vdi-wissensforum.de/weiterbildung-automobil/giesstechnik-im-motorenbau/) for casting technology in engine construction, which took place from 08 to 09 May 2023. The SCANEXPRESS was brought to the site on a trailer by truck and acted as one of the main attractions at the trade exhibition. All visitors were not only able to view the CT and ask their questions, but also received a **live demonstration** of an inspection. The component chosen for this was a stator housing. A focal point of the defect that was examined with AI was the wall thickness.

## Conference presentation: "Tailor-made CT inspection solution for short-term needs".

Prof. Dr. Lutz Hagner as CEO of Microvista GmbH gave a presentation on the topic of “Customised CT inspection solution for short-term needs”. In his presentation, he emphasised that typical recurring problems of all suppliers in the automotive industry can lead to a temporarily increased need for inspection. To meet this need, inspection solutions must be set up quickly and have a high throughput. Mobile solutions such as the SCANEXPRESS can meet these requirements and are therefore particularly well suited for casting technology in engine construction.

Other lecture topics offered the participants of the VDI conference the opportunity to learn about further new developments in casting technology in engine construction. The topics included:

-   General conditions for cast products in the powertrain
-   Casting technology for the modern drive mix
-   Design solutions for our future mobility
-   New requirements for materials and potentials
-   Innovative production processes

## Summary of the VDI conference

The automotive industry is constantly looking for new and innovative solutions to meet the demands of the ever-changing market dynamics. The demonstration of the SCANEXPRESS and the **positive as well as interested reactions of qualified executives on site**, showed that the mobile CT is an efficient solution for some of these requirements. The SCANEXPRESS thus **creates a practical advance for the non-destructive testing of castings** in engine construction.
