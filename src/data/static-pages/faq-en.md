# FAQ

## How large may the component to be scanned in the CT be?

The limits differ depending on the service used.

**1\. You send us your components & Microvista scans:**  
In this case, the envelope circle of your components can be up to 715 mm if a length of 1100 mm is not exceeded. If the envelope circle is 525 mm or smaller, even components with a length of up to 1600 mm can be inspected with industrial CT.

**2\. You scan & Microvista evaluates with AI via the cloud:**  
Under these circumstances, it depends on your CT how large the component to be tested may be.

**3\. You rent our mobile CT:**  
With this you can scan components with an envelope circle of up to 798 mm and a length of up to 1802 mm.

## What can be radiated with industrial CT?

This question cannot be answered in a general way. The interaction of the factors material, desired resolution and cumulative wall thicknesses (depending on the component geometry) have a significant influence on whether a component can be inspected with industrial CT. However, these are very individual. The fact that a component is made of heavy metal, for example, does not have to be an exclusion criterion for a CT inspection. It is therefore best to ask our experts for advice on whether and how quality control can be implemented for your components.

## How heavy may the component to be tested with CT be?

All Microvista CT systems can scan components weighing up to 100 kg.

## How does an industrial CT system work?

Depending on the technical implementation, the test object or a system consisting of an X-ray source and detector rotates. In the process, the test object is illuminated from many directions. The resulting X-ray images are called projections. With a lot of mathematics, these projections can then be used to create a digital image of the test object that also contains its internal structure in a good approximation.

## Which resolution is possible with CT?

Depending on the component size and material, tests can be carried out with a spatial resolution between 0.02 and 1 mm.

## How long does a CT scan take?

If you send us your components, our standard delivery time is 14 days. In the case of rush orders or series inspections, you are welcome to arrange individual solutions with our customer service (depending on the inspection task, scanning, evaluation & provision of the results can be carried out in less than 24 h).

If you rent the mobile CT – the Microvista SCANEXPRESS – you will automatically receive your results directly after the scan has been carried out.

When evaluating your scans via the Microvista Cloud, it depends on whether it is a single part inspection or a series inspection. However, an evaluation in both cases is usually possible in less than 24 hours.
