## Management

**Prof Dr Lutz Hagner** has been a member of the management at Microvista GmbH since the company was founded. Within the company, he focusses on non-destructive testing with industrial computed tomography in order to develop solutions that meet the increasing requirements for ensuring product quality. For this reason, the following topics have been worked on in recent years:

In addition to his work at Microvista, he also volunteers at the university, where he informs students about modern testing methods and automation technology on the Smart Automation programme.

His fascination with technology ranges from the moon landing to self-driving cars. For him, it is crucial to utilise the potential of all those involved in order to develop innovative solutions such as the ScanExpress.
